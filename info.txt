I should make this.

The program has a "Record" mode, and a "Play" mode.

In "Record" mode, it records your inputs. 
The inputs can be made while alt+tabbed into a fighting game.
After the combo, you tab out and click "Stop" in the program.
This saves the combo, you can name it.

In "Play" mode, you select a saved combo.
It replays the combo in DDR-style.
