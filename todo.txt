Save button
    Save button should resave a combo if it was originally loaded from a file. 
    If this is a newly recorded combo, prompt for a name and save.

Load button
    When the program starts, load all the filenames in the `combos` folder.
    "Load button" opens a list of all those combos. Click one to set it as the active combo.

Record button visuals
    The record button should turn red and slowly strobe while recording.

Replay button visuals
    The replay button should turn green and slowly strobe while playing.

Target row visuals
    The target row should not just be circles- it should be a circle with the button symbol in the middle.
    Target row symbols should be dark grey, but flash white when the button was pressed properly during a replay.
    Additionally, target row symbols should flash white whenever the button is pressed.
        i.e. even if no combo is loaded, user can spam controller buttons and see visual response immediately.

Replay symbols visuals
    Replay symbols are currently just circles. They should be a symbol representing the button. Matching colors!

Direction handling
    Currently, it works only for hitbox because directions are a button press.
    How does this extend to stick controllers? Should I already be adding diagonal arrows? That'd turn 4 arrows into 8.

Controller support
    Hitbox only because that's all I have.

Button press duration handling.
    Currently only button presses are recorded- the PRESS, not the key up or anything related to duration. Is that ok?

Audio clicks
    Play audio clicks so user can learn the rhythm of a recorded combo

Timeline
    Draw a timeline of the combo, so players can see a preview of what it looks like before replaying it.
